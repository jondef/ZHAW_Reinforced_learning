# Week 12: RL Showcase

## RL Examples

This week, there won't be a new lab. Instead, we will showcase some use-cases of RL. For the rest of the time, you're free to work on the graded lab.

### DQN

- **Trackmania (IQN)**: In this example, the IQN (Implicit Quantile Network) variant of DQN is applied in the Trackmania environment. Linesight demonstrates pro-level performance on a simple Tech-Track in March 2023, initially beaten by Wirtual and Loso after an initial loss. However, Linesight improved their RL-agent to surpass the new human world record on the same track in August 2023. They also demonstrated great results on the infamous Tech-track Hocolicious in September 2023, with some runs beating the human world record. Their code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com).

- **PPO & A2C - Pokemon**: PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) and A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic) algorithms are applied in the context of the Pokemon game. These reinforcement learning methods were used with iterative changes to the reward function to facilitate targeted improvement. You can watch the gameplay in the provided [video](video_link) and access the code for this project.

### Other

- **StarCraft - AlphaStar**: AlphaStar, an AI agent developed by DeepMind, achieved a remarkable feat by beating StarCraft pro players with a score of 5:0 in 2019. This achievement showcased the power of reinforcement learning in complex and real-time strategy games like StarCraft. You can watch the gameplay in the provided [video](video_link).

These examples demonstrate the versatility and capabilities of reinforcement learning algorithms in tackling various challenges and domains, from video games to real-time strategy games. They highlight the potential for RL to achieve superhuman performance and its ongoing development in the field of artificial intelligence.
